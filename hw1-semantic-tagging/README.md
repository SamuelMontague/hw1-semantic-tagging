# hw1-semantic-tagging

My mission was to edit and optimize semantic tags, for a better reading and navigating experience. 

My tasks:
    I edited some of the div tags to better suit the coding. Using my semantic tags I replaced most of the div tags with Section tags for a better navigating and search engine friendly experience. 
    I labeled alt attributes on the img links to help provide more knowledge for the original writer.
    I edited the heading attributes to ensure that all headings fell in sequential order. Also edit a div tag with a footer tag to better align with the website.
    I edited the title to give a quick and concise title that will be search engine friendly.
